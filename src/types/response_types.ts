/**
 * Response types should closely resemble the actual JSON response given by
 * sidecar. This means they should _not_ have Codec types. It is up to the
 * handler functions to apply the proper serialization of Codec types to ensure
 * they are the expected value. Not only does it gives us more fine grain control
 * of sidecar representation of values in response, this also enables us to
 * handle conversion errors on a case by case basis and give rich, meaningful
 * responses to the client.
 *
 * In sum, there should not be Codec types in any of these responses. Most of
 * the time the value type should either be `string` or `string | null`.
